# SQL-Portfolio
A portfolio of self-assigned SQL projects to display my competency. I am working out of the MySQL DBMS.

In the interest of displaying my self-taught SQL querying skills and understanding, this repo is dedicated to sharing self-assigned projects to build up a portfolio. In this, I will work with data sets of varying sizes to primarily conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA). I will display my my competnancy by implementing different functions and concepts in my projects relative to their complexity. From aggregate functions and joins to window functions, CTEs, and subqeurries, I want to display what I have been able to learn on this self-guided journey.

Thank you for visiting.

V.K.
