# SQL-Portfolio
A portfolio of self-assigned SQL projects to display my competency. I am working out of **Google BigQuery**.

In the interest of displaying my self-taught SQL skills and understanding of core concepts, this repo is dedicated to sharing self-assigned projects to build up a portfolio. In here, I will work with data sets of varying sizes to primarily conduct exploratory data analyses (EDA). I will display my competnancy by implementing different functions and concepts in my projects relative to their complexity. 

Thank you for visiting.
